# Nutshell: The Information Dashboard

## Authors: Sisi Freeley, David Larsen, Brett Stout, Tasha Lane
### Nutshell Cohort 41
Group project at Nashville Software School. As a team we received tickets to create a single-page application using vanilla Javascript which allows the user to store friends,messages, tasks, events, and articles to a database which is dynamically displayed on the DOM. Users can also chat with each other via a message/chat box and add each other as friends and save to a friends list.

This app is an easy to use social media application allowing our user to create messages,add tasks,schedule events and keep up with current articles,  When the user accesses the site they will begin at "Asking for Roses" registration page. Then they will login with secure email default user name and their own unique password. Users then can get send and receive messages. Chat with friends in a popup box. Create tasks to be complete and reminders. The application displays current interest articles downloaded from customized url. The friends list saves and retrieves friends. The friends list will also allow you to delete and edit. Once on the page you are able to keep up with no only friends but keep a list of scheduled events. The user is given options, and can select an "edit" button. If a edit button is chosen, the user is able to update and save.
